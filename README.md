## Usage

### Install Bazel

Install bazel to create a framework.

```
export BAZEL_VERSION=5.2.0
curl -fLO "https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/download/$BAZEL_VERSION/bazel-$BAZEL_VERSION-installer-darwin-x86_64.sh"
```

### Download Files

https://github.com/SeseriSalt/mediapipe/blob/simple_iris_framework/mediapipe/develop/iris/SYIris.h

https://github.com/SeseriSalt/mediapipe/blob/simple_iris_framework/mediapipe/develop/iris/SYIris.mm

https://github.com/SeseriSalt/mediapipe/blob/simple_iris_framework/mediapipe/develop/iris/info.plist

### Build the framework

```
$ bazel build --config=ios_fat --define 3D=true mediapipe/develop:HandTracker
```

If the build is successful, a zip file will be generated in `bazel-bin/mediapipe/develop/`, unzip it and you will find a .framework file.

If you replace the newly created framework with the currently configured one, the app should build successfully.

We are currently looking into making the framework available for implementation in Carthago. If you want to build it easily, please wait for a while.
